"""
This resolution can be notoriously hard to get working. Because one cannot get any indication of when the scripts on
a page have finished running, it is possible that some results are missed if one is not extremely careful.

Waiting until network traffic has ended should be the safest way to ensure that all javascript has loaded, and as such,
it would be the most likely point in time where the scripts on the visited page have exposed any useful information
to be gleamed.

Of course, that runs the risk of the operation timing out for whatever reason, or the operation taking a very long
time to complete. It also means that making it async risks that some information is missed due to errors, since
catching them would essentially negate the benefit of doing operations asynchronously.

Tweaks to this script can be made depending on each investigator's workflow.
